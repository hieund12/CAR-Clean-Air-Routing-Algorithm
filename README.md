# CAR-Clean-Air-Routing-Algorithm

This repository contains the source code for CAR application. To get more details about the algorithm, please have a look at our paper "CAR: The Clean Air Routing Algorithm for Path Navigation With Minimal PM2.5 Exposure on the Move" (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8863351). The paper is open access and available at the IEEE website. 
A demonstration of this work was also done at ACM MobiSys 2018 in Munich.
